# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Project Name: se_project_react

There is a header that renders the current month and year and the location.
There is two modals:
Add Clothes button opens a modal that allows a user to add a name, an image to the clothes section and indicate if it is a hot, warm or cold item
When you click on an item in the clothes section, a modal appears that displays the image and the name of the item

After building the backend project, we know have a mongodb attached that we can see items added through Postman and addItem button.
